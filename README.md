# Slime6-s-Games-Source-Codes
This is a reload of deleted post from Reddit by this guy: https://www.reddit.com/user/MorLaKOrNi. In this post been a link to Google Drive with a 2GB archive with all source codes and resources like images, sounds of games by slime6 (or Justgames99). If you want to make a remake, remaster, reimagining of some game, do it for your own desire. Otherwise do at all your own risk.
To download a archive, click Releases, and you see a file called "Archive x.x". Click and you will download it.
